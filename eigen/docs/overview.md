# Overview of Eigen

Eigen was created as an Objective-C application. Later, Swift was added. But in early 2016, we began a slow migration to React Native through a separate repo called Emission (for React Native components). You can [read about React Native on our Engineering Blog](https://artsy.github.io/series/react-native-at-artsy/). In 2020, [we merged Emisison and Eigen](https://github.com/artsy/eigen/pull/3022) into one repository.
