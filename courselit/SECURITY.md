# Security

We have done everything in our power to secure the application by following the best practices, we hope you understand that no one can guarantee that it is the most secure implementation out there and it will always stay secure.

Please audit the environment files, docker-compose files and other configurations properly as per your company's security standards. If you've discovered a security vulnerability, consider fixing the issue and submitting a PR.

Use the application at your own risk. People who have worked on this project will not be responsible for any sort of damage that happens to you by using the application.
