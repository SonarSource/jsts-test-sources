# SF Symbols React Native components - README

The components in this directory are exported versions of Apple's [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/). While Eigen (this repository) currently supports version iOS versions 12+, SF Symbols are only available beginning in iOS 13. As a result, the symbols used by Eigen have been ported here.

The SF Symbols guidelines linked above detail license information with this note:

> All SF Symbols shall be considered to be system-provided images as defined in the Xcode and Apple SDKs [license agreements](https://developer.apple.com/terms/) and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. You may not use SF Symbols — or glyphs that are substantially or confusingly similar — in your app icons, logos, or any other trademark-related use. Apple reserves the right to review and, in its sole discretion, require modification or discontinuance of use of any Symbol used in violation of the foregoing restrictions, and you agree to promptly comply with any such request.
