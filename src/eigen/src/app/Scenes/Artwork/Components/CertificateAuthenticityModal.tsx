              A certificate of authenticity (COA) is a document from an authoritative source that
              verifies the artworkâ€™s authenticity. While many COAs are signed by the artist, others
              will be signed by the representing gallery or the printmaker who collaborated with the
              artist on the work. For secondary market works, authorized estates or foundations are
              often the issuing party.

            <Text>
              COAs typically include the name of the artist, the details (title, date, medium,
              dimensions) of the work in question, and whenever possible an image of the work.
