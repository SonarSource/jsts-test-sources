# Release Process

The following guide walks you through releasing a new version of QUnit. If anything in the following process is found to be inaccurate or unclear, please update this document after you finish the release process so that future releases are easier.

## Preparing the release

Ensure that all requested changes have made it into the `master` branch of the repo for the pending release. For patch releases, ensure all bug fixes have landed; for minor releases, ensure all features have been included. Major releases will likely have their own special checklist.

Next, checkout the current `master` version of the repo and do the following:

* Install [git-extras](https://github.com/tj/git-extras) and run `git changelog -s <SHA1 of last preparation commit>` to update `History.md`. Clean up:
  * Replace `n.n.n` in the top section with the next release,
  * Ensure the previous release notes are still there,
  * Ensure there is no leading or trailing whitespace on the new lines,
  * Remove any Build or Tests commits that are irrelevant for users,
  * Refer to the formatting of previous entries when in doubt.
* Install `grunt-cli` globally (`npm install -g grunt-cli`).
* Run `grunt authors` and manually add any new authors to `AUTHORS.txt`. The order of this list doesn't change, so you should compare starting at the end. If you see duplicate entries proposed by the output of `grunt authors`, use the `mailmap` file to add entries for the canonical name and/or e-mail address, then run the grunt command again.
* Update the version property in `package.json` to have the right `-pre` version (e.g., if releasing version `2.3.0`, the version should be `2.3.0-pre`). This is not necessary for patch releases.

Commit all of the above with the following message:

	Build: Prepare @VERSION release, including authors and history update

Replace `@VERSION` with the version number you are releasing.

For the final preparatory step, push your new commit to `master` on GitHub. In order to do this, you'll need to disable branch protections for administrators. This can be done [here](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/settings/branch_protection_rules/511767). Once you're done with the release process, be sure to re-enable any protections you disabled.

## Performing the release

For the actual release, we will use [QUnit's fork of jquery-release](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit-release).

:warning: **WARNING** :warning:
> Before attempting the process below, make sure you have the proper permissions to publish to the jQuery CDN or else you will run into issues. If you have any doubts, ask someone who has done a release before to verify for you.
>
> Additionally, if you use 2FA on npm (which you should), make sure your account is in [**auth-only** mode](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-two-factor-authentication#levels-of-authentication) while doing the release. The release infrastructure does not currently support releasing with an OTP.

Always start this process from a fresh clone of the release repo:

	git clone https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit-release.git
	cd qunit-release

Then, simply run the script (requires `grunt-cli` to be installed globally):

	node release.js --remote=qunitjs/qunit

Follow the prompts along the way and you should be all good. This process:
* Creates a new clone of <https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit> under `__release` in the current directory (that's where you can check files during various steps).
* Creates a new release commit, tags it, and pushes it to GitHub.
* Creates a commit that bumps master to the next `pre` version, and pushes it to GitHub.
* Publishes the release to bower.
* Publishes the release to npm.
* Publishes the release to the jQuery CDN.

You can verify all of the above were correctly published by using the following:

* Bower: Run `bower info qunit` and verify the latest version number
* NPM: Visit <https://www.npmjs.com/package/qunit>
* CDN (release): Visit <https://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-x.x.x.js> (replacing `x.x.x` with the release number)
* CDN (pre-release): Visit <https://code.jquery.com/qunit/qunit-git.js> and ensure that
  the next `pre` version was built and published. Note that it may take a couple minutes for this version to update while [the build](http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/QUnit/) happens.

## Updating the website

Once you have successfully published the new release, we need to update the website.

    git clone git@github.com:qunitjs/qunitjs.com.git
    cd qunitjs.com

Checkout the latest `master` branch of the website repo.

If this release made any deprecating or breaking changes, check the examples and cookbooks and update them if they don't yet reflect the current best practices.

Next, do a find and replace of the previous version number and insert the new version number (**do not** update `package.json`, that will be done separately). Commit these changes with the following message:

	All: Update url and version to @VERSION

Next, use the `npm` command to tag the next website release. Usually, this will be the same as `@VERSION`, but the website will occasionally be a patch version ahead if a bug occurred in the website itself:

	npm version @WEBSITE_VERSION

The above command will change the version in `package.json`, commit it, and tag it. Next, just push the new version to `master`:

	git push --follow-tags

It is _important_ that you push the tag as that is what triggers a new website build and deployment.

Check the website in a few minutes after a build completes to verify it is updated.

If the website does not appear to be updating, you should check the Webhook to ensure a build was properly triggered. This can be done by going to the [Webhook Settings](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunitjs.com/settings/hooks) and ensuring the two "builder" hooks are "green".

## Updating the API documentation

The QUnit API documentation is published automatically via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) in the `docs` directory of the main repository. Since it is published automatically after every change you do not need to do anything special during a release.

## Final steps

You're almost there! Make sure you update [GitHub releases](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/releases) using the changelog from `History.md`.

Finally, make an announcement on the [@qunitjs](https://twitter.com/qunitjs) Twitter account. Mention highlights of the release if possible and feel free to include a second tweet if needed, but be sure to include a link to the release notes like so:

	Released @VERSION: https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/releases/tag/x.x.x

That's it! If you made it this far, congratulations you have successfully released a new version fo QUnit!

_Note: Remember to reset any branch protections or other settings changed during the release process._
